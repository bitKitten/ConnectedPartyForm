This branch was created to address the following issue: 
If two users are entering and saving info on the form, the email sent will contain all of the information from both. 
The database entries however will be correct.

Added sessions to the 'emailbody' variable as this is the only variable that stores data from the form outside of the database to build the body of the email.
